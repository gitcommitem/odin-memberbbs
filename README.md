# TOP Node.js Course Project - Members Only Message Board

07/14/2022 ~ 07/19/2022

## Objectives

Using express, passport.js, bcrypt.js, and heroku, create a message board that only allows registered users to create and read posts.

Your site should have the following:

- Users should be able to sign up with a username & password
- Users should be able to login with a username & password
- Users can "verify" their account to become members by entering a site code
- Users can become admins by entering a site code
- Admin users can delete posts

## Learnings

Feels really nice to have everything coming together, I feel more comfortable with fetching and updating data with mongoose and displaying data with handlebars.

Site code to become a member is github.

Site code to become an admin is odinproject.
